// Cuts a tile quad back to the visible screen when a slot may
// be shifted for stereo depth.
//
// Geometry outside the screen is normally thrown away by the
// rasterizer, so the paths above are free to run a tile past the
// edge. A shift moves that geometry sideways, which would carry
// it into view -- and what a game keeps just outside the screen
// is its own business. Worse, how far a tile hangs over the edge
// depends on the layer's scroll, which HDMA can change from one
// band of the frame to the next, so the strip a shifted slot
// leaves would step in and out down the screen.
//
// Cut to the screen instead. The strip is then exactly as wide
// as the slot's own shift, straight down the frame, and holds
// whatever sits behind that slot.
