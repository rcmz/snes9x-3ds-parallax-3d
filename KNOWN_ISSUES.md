# Known issues

## Old 3DS performance

[Super FX and SA-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_NES_enhancement_chips#List_of_Super_NES_games_with_enhancement_chips) titles are generally too demanding for full speed.
They are only listed below when there is another issue or a relevant New 3DS note.

Games with heavy in-frame palette changes can also struggle, typically racing games with scrolling road effects and/or gradient skies.

## In-frame palette changes

Set `In-Frame Palette Changes` to `Enabled` for the most accurate visuals.
Disabling it improves performance, but some games will show visible glitches. New 3DS uses `Enabled` by default.<br>
The examples below cover only some affected games.

* Top Gear 1 & 2 - bugged road textures (representative of several racers using the per-scanline road palette effect)
* Super Turrican - missing background gradients (representative of several games using HDMA sky/background gradients)
* Mortal Kombat 2 - glitched small character portraits
* Timon & Pumbaa's Jungle Games - GFX glitches on the menu and during gameplay


## Flickering horizontal line
Some games show a thin flickering horizontal line, often at the very top of the screen, sometimes further down. Noticeable in games like Super Metroid or SMW2. This is probably a timing issue. These games are considered fully playable, so they are not listed individually in the table below.

## Audio accuracy
This core is based on **snes9x 1.43**, which uses the older, less accurate SNES APU rather than Blargg's APU, so a few games have inaccurate or glitchy audio.

## Per-layer 3D depth

A slot given a depth slides sideways between the two eyes, which pulls content in
from outside the visible screen. Nothing valid is guaranteed to be there, so each
eye leaves that strip undrawn: the right eye at its left edge, the left eye at
its right, as wide as the largest shift in force. Larger depths therefore cost a
few more pixels of picture at one edge of each eye.

Mode 7 encodes depth as a single bit rather than one of the interleaved slots,
so its planes take no depth at all.

Windows and colour-math regions stay in screen space rather than moving with the
slot they mask, so a windowed effect over a slot with depth is off by that slot's
shift at the mask edge.

## Game-specific issues

The tables are based on the [Snes9x for 3DS Compatibility List](http://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/Snes9x_for_3DS), narrowed to titles flagged with problems (entries reported as running fine were removed). The original list is partly outdated and not all entries have been re-verified for this fork, so treat it as a starting point, not a guarantee.

Issues can have different causes, including emulator bugs, unsupported SNES accessories, and missing broadcast or CD-era services.

Regions and statuses come from the original list. The notes have been reworded and shortened, with updates where behavior has since changed. Regional duplicates are merged into a single row where the issue is the same.

Testing notes refer to Old 3DS and New 3DS. "Old 3DS" also covers the original 2DS and "New 3DS" covers the New 2DS XL.

Some entries originally reported as "flicker" were also dropped, where the cause is the 3DS display's motion blur - pixel art can smear while the image scrolls (e.g. Super Mario World, also visible on Virtual Console), not an emulation issue. Scaling up with a smooth filter (e.g. 4:3 Fit) makes it less noticeable.

Status follows the original list's definitions:

🟡&nbsp;**Issues** - games that mostly work but with more serious yet playable bugs<br>
🔴&nbsp;**Broken** - games that do not load and have major problems and/or are unplayable, or have consistent lockups.

### Satellaview (BS-X) games

Place the BIOS file at `3ds/snes9x/BS-X.bin` with that exact filename and casing - some titles need it, some don't.
There are SoundLink games whose music was streamed live, so offline that audio is gone.
Several titles also hang on broadcast "wait" or "time-check" screens.
Some can be skipped via _fast forward_ or a community patch, others won't get past them at all.

The table below lists problematic games on this emulator.
For general Satellaview background - including compatibility categories and available patches - see this [community games list](https://forums.launchbox-app.com/topic/90630-nintendo-satellaview-organised-functional-games-list-no-more-guessing/).
